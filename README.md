Android Cine app
============================

This project was built as a project for high school course. As i said this try to rescue some concepts about a projects on Android.


Build and Run
============================

When you run for first time the project (MainActivity.java),
note that after it, you will need to comment the lines 49 and from 59 to 65 at MainActivity.java.
This is because i want to avoid database problems when you run the application a second time.

Notes
============================

As additional information. I put the effects swipe left and swipe right, they only need to be 
implemented in their respective methods.
